This final project aims to create a blog to be used internally by a travel agency or similar to share among employees client reviews and experiences. 
For doing this, employees should register to build a centralized database of client's trips around the world, to serve as inspiration to potential 
customers and encourage them to explore whatâ€™s out there.
Among the different functionalities that it has, we can find:
- Register and create new users
- Update existing users
- Create new posts to share trips experiences
- Update content in posts that were already created
- Delete old material that is no longer relevant
